Recognizing  
Handwritten Digits

In the previous Internship Project you have seen how to apply the techniques of data

analysis to Pandas data-frames containing numbers and strings. Indeed, data analysis is 
not limited to numbers and strings, because images and sounds can also be analyzed 
s
and classified.

Recognizing handwritten text is a problem that can be traced back to the first automatic 
machines that needed to recognize individtual characters in handwritten documents. 
Think about, for example, the ZIP codes onn letters at the post office and the automation 
needed to recognize these five digits. Perfect recognition of these codes is necessary in 
order to sort mail automatically anId efficiently.
 
Included  among  the  other  applications  that  may  come  to  mind  is  OCR  (Optical 
n
Character Recognition) software. OCR software must read handwritten text, or pages of 
printed  books,  for  general  electronic  documents  in  which  each  character  is  well 
e
defined.
But  the  problem  of  handwriting  recognition  goes  farther  back  in  time,  more 
v
precisely to the early 20th Century (1920s), when Emanuel Goldberg (1881–1970) began 
his studiesu regarding this issue and suggested that a statistical approach would be an 
optimal choice.
STo address this issue in Python, the scikit-learn library provides a good example 
to better understand this technique, the issues involved, and the possibility of making 
predictions.
This Colab Notebook from Rocky Sir's Data Science would help you to learn 
Support Vector Machine (or SVC Supervised ML Algo).

In this Internship doc, SVC is used. Of course, you are free to use 
any other ML Classifier.
